description: Guidelines for recording new exceptions into ERROR_HISTORY.md for traceability.

When you add `except` blocks for **new** exceptions or handle previously unseen runtime errors:
1. Open or create `ERROR_HISTORY.md` in the repo root.
2. Append entry using template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD
- <ExceptionName>: <short description>
  • Context: file.py:line
  • Cause   : …
  • Fix     : …
```

This diary helps track recurring issues and their solutions.
